# INDUSTRIAL-SECURITY-AUTOMATION-USING-IOT
The main aim of this proposed project is to design and implement a flexible, costeffective and powerful IoT Based Industrial Automation security system. An IoT based Industrial Automation system is needed for the occupantâ€™s convenience and safety. This system helps you to detect burglary, leaking of harmful gas, smoke caused due to fire and after detecting suspicious activity, it sends an alarm message to the owner number as well as security personnel. Our purpose of this project is to use our study &amp; skill to provide a healthy and safe environment in industries with low cost IoT technology. Earlier Industries used to monitor the things by using RFID system where it was only used for short distance communication. To reduce the manual overhead, the thing which we are introducing is automation of industries using internet of things which can overcome the RFID shorter distance problem. Using IOT in industries we can monitor and control the industrial machineries more easily.
